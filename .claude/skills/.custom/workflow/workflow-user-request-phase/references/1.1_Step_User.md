# Step 1.1: User Request

## Role

You are the **user** providing initial input for a new function implementation.

## Inputs

None (this is the starting point of the workflow).

## Context to Read

None required at this stage.

## Instructions

### 1. Describe Your Function

Provide a description of the function/implementation you want to develop.

Consider including:
- What problem does this solve?
- What is the primary user action?
- What are the main inputs and outputs?
- Any specific constraints or requirements?

**Example**:
"I want to create an invoice generator that takes form data and generates a PDF invoice with company branding."

### 2. Provide to Orchestrator

Your description will be passed to the orchestrator (step 1.2) who will refine it with you through a dialog.

## Outputs

- **user_story_description**: Your initial function description

This output becomes the input for step 1.2 (Orchestrator Initial Dialog).

## Checkcard Filling

**Agent Type**: Main Agent (Orchestrator fills this as input tracking)

**IMPORTANT**: User does NOT fill this checkcard. The orchestrator fills it to track user input as the workflow's starting point.

**Checkcard Location**: `workflow/checkcards/checkcards-1.1-to-2.2.json`

Orchestrator finds checkcard with `step_id: "1.1"` and fills:

```json
{
  "step_id": "1.1",
  "step_name": "User Request",
  "agent": "user",
  "description": "User describes which function/implementation they want to develop",

  "inputs": {
    "user_initial_input": null  // Not applicable (starting point)
  },

  "context_reads": [],

  "loops": null,

  "outputs": {
    "user_story_description": "I want to create an invoice generator..."
  },

  "status": "completed",
  "started_at": "2025-01-15T10:20:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2025-01-15T10:25:00Z",
  "duration_minutes": 5
}
```

**Filled By**: Orchestrator (Main Agent tracks user input)

## Next Step

Orchestrator proceeds to step 1.2: Initial Dialog to refine your description.
